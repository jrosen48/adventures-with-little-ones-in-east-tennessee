# About the Book and Acknowledgments and Credits {-}

## How this book was created {-}

This book is initially being written in the "open"; this means that others can and have made suggestions that have improved it. Thank you to those who read and provided feedback on the book. We used the bookdown R package to render the book and GitHub pages to host the book. 

Unless mentioned, we have taken all of the photos used in this book. 

We have also created all of the maps used in this book using publicly-available data. We acknowledge those publicly-available sources next.

### Acknowledgments {-}

Thank you to [Isabella Vel√°squez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/) for creating and sharing the R code to create trail maps; this code was essential to being able to create beautiful (we think!) trail maps for this book. 

Thanks to [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://www.tylermw.com/), whose [tutorial on creating trail maps](https://www.tylermw.com/adding-open-street-map-data-to-rayshader-maps-in-r/) was also instrumental.

Thank you to [Daniel Anderson](https://github.com/datalorax) for the basis for [the theme](https://github.com/datalorax/sds-r/blob/main/style.css) for this book. 

Thank you to Conor Anderson [for the CSS code for the call-out boxes](https://gitlab.com/claut/man_ccia) in this text.
