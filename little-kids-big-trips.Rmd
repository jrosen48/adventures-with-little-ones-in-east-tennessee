# Why are we writing this book? {#why}

<img src="img/abrams-family.jpg" alt="Our family at Abrams Falls" width="400"/>

- We have been taking trips for around years
- During the past year, due to COVID, outdoor trips were the main thing we did with our child
- We have done a lot of research, but we are only writing about places we have visited, hiked, paddled, and camped at with our little one
- Its location is really great ([see here](https://recreationlinks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Outdoor_RecMap-MapSide__2ndEdition_04jul2018.pdf))
- It can be under-rated and hard to learn about

Principles that motivate this book:

- We write about places we go to regularly; in principle, at least twice, and in many cases, many times more than that.

# Getting started {#getting-started}

## Gear

'Good' gear is at once over-rated and under-rated. Allow us to explain.

## Fitness

Start small. Know your limits, have a bail out.

## Weather

Many guides describe the Tennessee weather in a way like the following:

> In East Tennessee, there are four seasons of weather, including a hot, humid summer, and a cold winter, with temperatures regularly dipping below freezing. Spring and fall bring mild weather, with a lot of variation, especially around the shoulder months of March-April and October-November.

This is mostly true, but it fails to capture what it's _like_ to live in this area. We moved from Michigan---and Michigan is certainly a place in which there are four seasons. Indeed, it sometimes feels like the winter is the longest season in Michigan. That's not the case in Tennessee as the _balance_ between the seasons is different and this has profound impacts. 

We'll try to summarize the _experience_ of each of the seasons in East Tennessee and how the progression of a typical year may unfold.

## Safety

A question that many ask about the Smokies, particularly, but also hiking, generally, has to do with safety concerning a very specific concern: bears. [There are black bears in the Smokies](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/black-bears.htm): around 1,500 of them. 

Moreover, [there are black bears in the Big South Fork area](https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7040&context=utk_gradthes) of the Cumberland Plateau: The latest estimates suggest that a population of around one dozen bears that were introduced in the late 1990s are doing very well and now comprise a population of nearly 1,000 bears. 

Given these numbers of bears and the number of visitors to both parks - [more than 12M to the Smokies in 2020 alone](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/news/park-experiences-more-than-12-million-visits-in-2020.htm), the number of people who are harmed by bears can be instructive. 

<> [There is data](https://outforia.com/danger-parks/#all-data) on the number of people killed in the Smokies. These data provide an important context for a discussion of safety (note, we'll also discuss safety-related issues that don't have to do with death). From 2010-2020, the National Park Service recorded 92 deaths. 42 were from automobile or other transportation-related accidents. 15 were medical/natural deaths. Six were drownings, three were falls, two were poisoning, and 10 were either "environmental" or in the other category.

Denominator [https://www.psblaw.com/nevada/deaths-in-us-national-parks/]

The park has seen, on average, more than 10M visitors/year from the 2010-2020 period. In the entire history of the park, [there have been around six bear attacks](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2020/09/14/great-smokies-rangers-identify-man-found-dead-park-black-bear-scavenging-his-remains/5793471002/) and there have been two deaths from those attacks (in 2000 and 2020). Considering deaths in the last decade, this suggests that bear attacks are exceedingly rare---on the order of one in one hundred million. 

Something a lot of people mention about the Smokies is the prevalence of bears. From what I can tell, there have been 6-7 bear attacks in the history of the park and two deaths (2000 & 2020) from them. Those are bad, but the park received ~100M visitors from 2010-2019 alone. This suggests that the risk of dying from a bear attack is around in 100M. The risk of being attacked is somewhere around 1 in 30-60M (as it's somewhat unclear when the documented attacks occurred).

# General Strategies {#strategies}

There are different trips for different days.

We use the below criteria for reviewers. For example, consider a close, accessible, family-friendly location that does not have any camping options; these are rated along a 1 (minimal) to 5 (maximum) degree of the following;

|Criterion|Rating|
|--------|---------:|
|Accessibility of location|4|
|Family-friendliness|5|
|Beauty|3|
|Proximity to amenities|4|
|Camping options|NA|
