## Acknowledgments

Thank you to [Isabella Vel√°squez](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/) for creating and sharing the R code to create trail maps; this code was essential to being able to create beautiful (we think!) trail maps for this book. 

Thank you to [Daniel Anderson](https://github.com/datalorax) for the basis for [the theme](https://github.com/datalorax/sds-r/blob/main/style.css) for this book. 

Thank you to Samuel Weisbord, Aaron Rosenberg, and Kevin Lane for photos included in this book.
