## Overview

Abrams Creek is a great place to start if you live in or around Knoxville. The trailhead---the place where one trail (or, often, several trails) begin---is the lowest elevation of any in the park: the trailhead is at 1,168 feet; Knoxville's is 886. For many, it's also the closest trailhead, taking less than an hour to travel to from most parts of Knoxville.

Though accessible, it's not nothing in terms of scenery: It has what we would think of as "National Park-level" beauty. There are many great trails as well as backcountry camping options; many of both are along the creek. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies; the best thing I can say about Abrams Creek is that we always seem to have fun when we go there.

## A story

Abrams Creek is sort of special. I think the reason why it's special is partially because of good memories that we've had there. When we moved to Knoxville in May of 2018, my brother and I decided to go on a short overnight backpacking trip. Areas Creek was the closest part of the Smokies to Knoxville and we were hoping that my parents and wife and son could come and join us. I remember when we were walking in we were quickly surrounded by massive hemlock. And it just felt like a magical place. Our first night, we camped at the backcountry site, just about a mile and from the trailhead. In the next morning, we ran to Abrams Falls. And then back to me, my parents wife and little one I had no idea what to expect was our first trip to the Smokies and I had very few reference points. Another moment I remember was rounding a corner to approach a rooms halls. There was something about it that felt like you were just entering somewhere different. I think this could have to do with the geography of the area in that Abrams is the lowest trailhead in the park. And so in a sense, the area around the trailhead is distinct from the rest of the park. But as you approach Abrams Falls, you approach the Cades Cove area,  the elevation is considerably higher, and it feels a little bit different. Not that the area outside is not special, but it just feels different. I think if I could capture my experience of the Smokies little moments like this where you turn a corner on a hiking trail, and then there's someplace magical that's far from the only place where I've experienced this. 

## Getting There and Getting One's Bearings

The drive there is also _mostly_ easy, but with enough excitement to make that part of the adventure interesting. Getting to Abrams Creek involves driving south from the Knoxville past the the Tyson-McGee Airport and then Maryville. Soon after leaving the outskirts of Maryville, the road climbs up <add ridge name> with the Foothills Parkway; the road becomes quite steep, but still accessible. After crossing under the Foothills Parkway, you drive down into the area outside of the Abrams Creek Trailhead and Campground.

It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be _a bit_ confusing. This is because the campground is further along the same road the trailhead is on. Also, there are two areas to park for the trailhead: One is near the large sign with maps of this area of the National Park, and the other is right before the gate that is closed when the campground closes (<dates>). We usually park by the gate.

## Adventures

There are several trails that we enjoy.

### Little Adventure

```

A little adventure involves walking from the trailhead to the campground. This may not sound like much, but it's actually a great walk along the creek on a wide, gravel road. Moreover, the campground - like Abrams Creek - is almost never full, apart from prime weekends and holidays, and it's a great spot to rest by picnic tables and hang out around the creek.

### Big Adventure

A big adventure goes even further along the Little Bottoms trail to one of the prettiest backcountry sites in the park. Not to say that you should stay overnight; instead, this is a great place to stop and relax and to have a big adventure. This trail is XX miles and involves XX elevation change.

### Nearby

A great trip nearby Abrams Creek is Look Rock. This is not strictly near the trailhead; instead, it's nearby the drive back, involving a turn-off just as you pass under the Foothills Parkway on the way to or from Abrams Creek.
