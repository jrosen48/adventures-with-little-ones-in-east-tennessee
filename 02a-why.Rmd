# Background, Purpose, and Audience

We moved to Knoxville from Michigan in 2018. We were somewhat familiar with doing activities outdoors in Michigan: we took walks or hikes around where we lived in Lansing and occasionally camped, especially on the shores of Lake Michigan. 

When we moved, we knew about the Smokies - it's hard not to read about them when reading about Knoxville. But, the Smokies are *huge* - and while there is a lot of information about the Smokies available, it can be hard to parse. Are these recommended places also the most busy? Where are the hidden gems - the places locals go? hat's practical to make it to on a day trip from Knoxville? It's too easy to end up on a busy trail (or, much worse, stuck in traffic) in the amazing place that is the Smokies, instead of enjoying one of the most incredible outdoors areas in the world (really!). 

We didn't know about much besides the Smokies. We heard a bit about the Urban Wilderness and Ijams, both a few minutes from downtown.

At the same time, we saw maps like this one at Recreation Links ([https://recreationlinks.org](https://recreationlinks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Outdoor_RecMap-MapSide__2ndEdition_04jul2018.pdf)). There seemed to be even more, including in the direction away from the Smokies. What is the Obed river? And Big South Fork? 

Then, as we are too aware, COVID-19 happened. Especially with a young child in the early days of the pandemic, there were not many activities to do: even events outdoors (and, early on, even playgrounds!) were closed.

Lastly, Knoxville can be welcoming, but it also has an element that can be closed to newcomers. This extended to outdoors activities, making it somewhat challenging to know what to do---and, lacking one or even a few resources that could point us as parents in the right direction.

Collectively, the above reasons invited us to start to learn more about the outdoors areas around Knoxville. We started slow - a trip to the part of the Smokies closest to Knoxville, Abrams Creek; a drive out to Obed Wild & Scenic River on a whim; hearing about Seven Islands Birding State Park within 30 minutes of our house and taking a morning excursion there. The results were good. We liked the places we went.

As we spent more time exploring (and the COVID-19 pandemic did not relent), we explored more, returning to the same places - Abrams Creek in the Smokies, Obed Wild & Scenic River, Seven Islands State Birding Park - and traveling to new places---places across the Smokies, places nearer to our house in the Tennessee Valley (that includes Knoxville), and places to the other side of the Smokies, on and around what we learned is termed the Cumberland Plateau. We started to make memories as a family and individually - trips around holidays and birthdays for which the weather was just right, we were happy to be together, and we started to feel like we liked this place.

This book is the result of these experiences. It resulted from a lot of *doing* and a lot of *learning about* the places around Knoxville.

## Purpose and Audience 

Our aim in writing this is primarily to serve as an accessible guide to others looking to learn more about the outdoors around Knoxville. It is written with someone either new to Knoxville or someone who is looking to learn about the outdoors areas around Knoxville. For example, we take care to explain what we mean when we point to locations like the Cumberland Plateau (and how locations like *The Plateau* are different from the Smokies and the area in which Knoxville may be found, the Tennessee Valley.)

It will also have elements that will be of interest to those with more knowledge about and experience exploring the outdoors around Knoxville. For example, we've included detailed trail maps for each location and we include historical and scientific information to add context to the areas we describe. 

Another key part of our audience is adults caring for kids. In fact, this is core to our boke. This isn't a generic book on exploring the outdoors; it's one with an eye toward adventures that can be done with children. That's not to say the adventures lack ambition: kids can do a lot! But, it also means that the focus is, for the most part, on trips that kids can enjoy. We think that other readers will still find elements to take away from this book, but we note that our focus is on this particular audience.

Lastly, hiking is not in the title of our book, but our focus is mostly on walks and hikes to explore the outdoors. We do mention other activities often. When we first moved to Knoxville, we were surprised by how many people mentioned hiking as something they do---or, at least, as something they've done. There are certainly other activities to do: paddling (on a paddle board, kayak, or canoe), run (and trail run), and camp and backpack, to begin. We do mention opportunities to do these, but focus on hiking as an activity that is accessible to many.

To sum up the above, this is a book *primarily* but not exclusively for those looking to explore the outdoors around Knoxville, TN who hope to do so with children. No experience with exploring the outdoors, in general, nor with the outdoors around Knoxville, is assumed. We focus on hiking, but mention other activities when relevant. Having established the audience, we next turn to some *other* aspects of the book.
