# Introduction to the Tennessee Valley

Transcribed by https://otter.ai

words that don't come to mind when talking about, we're thinking about the Tennessee Valley. Our epic, just real, quick, wild remote. Instead, the Tennessee Valley is compared to the Smokies and Cumberland Plateau, relatively tame, quite accessible, and in some ways a little bit mundane. However, the Tennessee Valley has several special spots. And at least compared to areas in which I've lived in the past, is kind of special spots will not only be nice, but would be wonderful destinations on their own. And indeed, they are still wonderful destinations on their own. Even when the Smokies were the Cumberland Plateau or I'll briefly describe what has become one of our family's favorite spots, seven islands is deeper. seven islands is only 30 minutes from Knoxville. And from looking on a map at it, you can get the sense that it's pretty because it's the French Broad River. But that there's not anything special about it apart from the fact that it's a burning State Park. However, the drive out to it betrays this sense. sort of similar to the Obed. Getting there is a little bit weird. As soon as you exit the interstates, it's not really clear whether you're headed the right way. And Google maps often presents multiple greens that are about the same distance. Moreover, it's not really clear where the state park begins and other lands. And there's certain parts where it looks like it's managed by the State Park Service, but it's actually just part of the road there. In any case, once you approach the road leading up to this depart, you get the sense that there's something special.

There's the kind of combination of farm and pastoral mountain scenery. That always surprises me. You can typically see some of the mountains from the drive up but not all. And once

parking at the parking lot, you can head one of at least four different ways. The first way is out the paved path. And this leads to a bridge that crosses the French rock grammar to one of my left with a short trailer on it. The second way involves hitting up a ridge along meadow, and this way offers great views of mountains and clear days, especially given that we're in the relatively far eastern portion of the park. A third way involves going up into the forest. And for some reason, this trail always delights me, it's only about a mile and change. But I don't seem to go up there without having some kind of special experience. For instance, seeing about a dozen here on a fairly working day fall day. Or going with my son and friend and is having what felt like an epic little mountain hike in a fairly short period of time. The fourth way is a route down to a different part of the park. I'm diving into the details here without focusing on the Gestalt which is the seminar islands, she says something special about it, I don't know how else to describe it. Especially when you're on the fringe, Robert Murray just feels like a kind of place to clear your mind, even within half an hour. It feels very, very different than even the amazing places that are not so sometimes, or even places that are also in Knox County such as house well. I think times, the best thing I can say about southern islands is that it has a bit you can hike, I can walk on a path, you can head over a bridge to River Island, you can paddle the only thing that's missing is camping. And in some ways, I'm kind of glad that it doesn't have camping and that it becomes a special kind of a trip or a spa place that you can't ever really feel like you completely understand because you can't stay there for more than half a day or so. I'll say a few more things about the Tennessee Valley. This is a big area and in some ways, it's the area that I feel like I know the least. But I'll speak to a few other spots that are present here. One is North stamp State Park and Norton says kind of quasi weird and quasi while in a kind of quasi Cumberland ish kind of way. The name itself is epic, and it's kind of 1950s Harsh architectural style. And the area and hiking trails around Norris are pretty nice.

It's not quite the strongest endorsement so let me try that I actually don't have a lot to say about horse yet

another spot I'll mention is house mount house is about the same distance from Knoxville as separate island property, and it has that feature of being somewhere a world removed from Knoxville despite being only a short drive away. One thing that always strikes me about housebound is that it's quite steep. You might not expect it in the context of the Smokies being nearby. But the hike is really intense and it's challenged me and my family multiple times. The overlooks from Haas mountain I'm pretty good. To the Thomas nice
