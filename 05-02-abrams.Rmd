## Overview

Abrams Creek is a great place to start if you live in or around Knoxville. The trailhead---the place where one trail (or, often, several trails) begin---is the lowest elevation of any in the park: the trailhead is at 1,168 feet; Knoxville's is 886. For many, it's also the closest trailhead, taking less than an hour to travel to from most parts of Knoxville.

Though accessible, it's not nothing in terms of scenery: It has what we would think of as "National Park-level" beauty. There are many great trails as well as backcountry camping options; many of both are along the creek. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies; the best thing I can say about Abrams Creek is that we always seem to have fun when we go there.

## Getting there

The drive there is also _mostly_ easy, but with enough excitement to make that part of the adventure interesting. Getting to Abrams Creek involves driving south from the Knoxville past the the Tyson-McGee Airport and then Maryville. Soon after leaving the outskirts of Maryville, the road climbs up <add ridge name> with the Foothills Parkway; the road becomes quite steep, but still accessible. After crossing under the Foothills Parkway, you drive down into the area outside of the Abrams Creek Trailhead and Campground.

## Trail Description

It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be _a bit_ confusing. This is because the campground is further along the same road the trailhead is on. Also, there are two areas to park for the trailhead: One is near the large sign with maps of this area of the National Park, and the other is right before the gate that is closed when the campground closes (<dates>). We usually park by the gate.


A little adventure involves walking from the trailhead to the campground. This may not sound like much, but it's actually a great walk along the creek on a wide, gravel road. Moreover, the campground - like Abrams Creek - is almost never full, apart from prime weekends and holidays, and it's a great spot to rest by picnic tables and hang out around the creek.

A medium-sized adventure involves hiking past the campground along the Cooper Road trail to the Little Bottoms trail to a great place to stop for lunch. This trail is XX miles and involves XX elevation change.

A big adventure goes even further along the Little Bottoms trail to one of the prettiest backcountry sites in the park. Not to say that you should stay overnight; instead, this is a great place to stop and relax and to have a big adventure. This trail is XX miles and involves XX elevation change.

### Nearby

A great trip nearby Abrams Creek is Look Rock. This is not strictly near the trailhead; instead, it's nearby the drive back, involving a turn-off just as you pass under the Foothills Parkway on the way to or from Abrams Creek.
