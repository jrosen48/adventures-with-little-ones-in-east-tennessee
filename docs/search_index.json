The trailhead—the place where one trail (or, often, several trails) begin—is the lowest elevation of any in the park: the trailhead is at 1,168 feet; Knoxville’s is 886. For many, it’s also the closest trailhead, taking less than an hour to travel to from most parts of Knoxville. Though accessible, it’s not nothing in terms of scenery: It has what we would think of as “National Park-level” beauty. There are many great trails as well as backcountry camping options; many of both are along the creek. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies; the best thing I can say about Abrams Creek is that we always seem to have fun when we go there. A story Three brief stories about Abrams Creek illustrate how it’s not only close, but accessible. The first was a time Josh and his brother Aaron went hiking soon after Katie and Josh moved to Knoxville. They went hiking - backpacking - with the family meeting the next day. Soon after setting out on the trail, they were surrounded by massive Hemlock. Aaron said to Josh something like, “Dude.” That was all that needed to be said. It was a special place. Another was the next day, on a long trip (a run) to Abrams Falls from the backcountry site. When rounding the corner to approach the falls, one turns a bit away from the trail up toward the waterfall. There was something about it that felt like you were just entering somewhere different. I think this could have to do with the geography of the area in that Abrams is the lowest trailhead in the park. And so in a sense, the area around the trailhead is distinct from the rest of the park. But as you approach Abrams Falls, you approach the Cades Cove area, the elevation is considerably higher, and it feels a little bit different. Not that the area outside is not special, but it just feels different. I think if I could capture my experience of the Smokies little moments like this where you turn a corner on a hiking trail, and then there’s someplace magical. A last time was on Father’s Day. We hiked with our son to the Little Bottoms site - the Medium Adventure for Abrams Creek described below. There was something about arriving at the campsite. The creek was pretty, the light was perfect, and we had gone really far together. It was special. Onward to more details on Abrams Creek. Getting There and Getting One’s Bearings The drive there is also mostly easy, but with enough excitement to make that part of the adventure interesting. Getting to Abrams Creek involves driving south from the Knoxville past the the Tyson-McGee Airport and then Maryville. Soon after leaving the outskirts of Maryville, the road climbs up with the Foothills Parkway; the road becomes quite steep, but still accessible. After crossing under the Foothills Parkway, you drive down into the area outside of the Abrams Creek Trailhead and Campground. knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;abrams-road.jpg&quot;)) Figure 1: The road to Abrams Creek It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be a bit confusing. This is because the campground is further along the same road the trailhead is on. Also, there are two areas to park for the trailhead: One is near the large sign with maps of this area of the National Park, and the other is right before the gate that is closed when the campground closes (). We usually park by the gate. Adventures There are several trails that we enjoy. Little Adventure A little adventure involves walking from the trailhead to the campground. This may not sound like much, but it’s actually a great walk along the creek on a wide, gravel road. Moreover, the campground - like Abrams Creek - is almost never full, apart from prime weekends and holidays, and it’s a great spot to rest by picnic tables and hang out around the creek. knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;abrams-campground-walking.jpeg&quot;)) Figure 2: The road to Abrams Creek Medium-Sized Adventure A medium-sized adventure involves hiking past the campground along the Cooper Road trail to the Little Bottoms trail to a great place to stop for lunch. This trail is XX miles and involves XX elevation change. This adventure involves some creek crossings. knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;abrams-high-water-crossing.jpeg&quot;)) Figure 3: The road to Abrams Creek It also involves some climbing. knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;abrams-vista.jpg&quot;)) Figure 4: A look at Abrams Creek from the Little Bottoms trail knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;abrams-high.jpeg&quot;)) Figure 5: Returning to the Creek on the Little Bottoms trail Big Adventure knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;output&quot;, &quot;abrams.png&quot;)) Figure 6: Abrams: Big Adventure Trail Map A big adventure goes even further along the Little Bottoms trail to one of the prettiest backcountry sites in the park. Not to say that you should stay overnight; instead, this is a great place to stop and relax and to have a big adventure. This trail is XX miles and involves XX elevation change. knitr::include_graphics(here(&quot;img&quot;, &quot;josh-backpacking-abrams.jpeg&quot;)) Figure 7: Backpacking along the Little Bottoms trail Nearby A great trip nearby Abrams Creek is Look Rock. This is not strictly near the trailhead; instead, it’s nearby the drive back, involving a turn-off just as you pass under the Foothills Parkway on the way to or from Abrams Creek.
