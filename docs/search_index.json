Welcome to our book! I’ve been meaning to work on Little Kids, Big Trips in Knoxville, an open book, for awhile, but like for several (work-related and other) things, I have dropped the ball a bit. To get the ball rolling, I’m going to share a few thoughts on why it can be hard to understand the Smokies as well as a bit of what I’ve come to understand about them. This is nice. Why it can be hard to understand the Smokies The Smokies can be a bit hard to get one’s head around at first. It can be hard to get one’s head around the Smokies for several reasons: Their size: more than 800 square miles Their location: split roughly between Tennessee and North Carolina, there are many ways to access the park, and there isn’t a primary or best way to do so Their variation in altitude: Abrams Creek—the trailhead nearest to Knoxville—is roughly 850 feet above sea level, whereas Clingman’s Dome is roughly 6,650 feet above sea level Their biodiversity: it may be the most biodiverse National Park Their human history: thousands of people of European ancestry lived in what is now the National Park up until as recently as 1934 (when the park was established); before people of European ancestry lived there, thousands of people of Cherokee ancestry lived there; these histories remain alive and present within the park I think these reasons are important in general and in a bit of an abstract sense, but they also have a more personal angle: The Smokies are hard to experience for each of these and other reasons, too. They appear and are different in different seasons. They are very different when experienced when walking than when driving in a car. They are different when it’s rainy and when it’s not. And, they are different alone, with family, with friends, and with a child. A bit on my understanding of the Smokies When my wife and I first decided to move to Knoxville, I began trying to understand the Smokies, and since then I’ve read a lot of books and spent a lot of time there. I don’t think I can adequately summarize the Smokies, but I can begin to convey my understanding. The Smokies are a timeless place, at once welcoming and severe. When I drive to the Smokies, I feel like I’m entering into a special place. That special feeling is amplified by the good memories I’ve had there—with my family and friends and on my own. I value living by the Smokies a lot. This is a function of a lot of things coming together: stopping refereeing soccer, something I’d done for around 12 years up to that point, soon after we moved to Knoxville, the pandemic, which prevented many other activities from happening, and a live for doing things outdoors that motivated me to study biology and enter teaching to begin. I’ll describe just one trip to try to work to summarize my understanding of the Smokies. In May, 2020, my wife and little one and I hiked the beginning of the Bote Mountain and West Prong trails to the location of Backcountry site #18. It was one of our first times heading out after the pandemic began, and it was a moderately difficult hike - around three miles, but with nearly 1,000 feet of climbing. When we arrived at the site—where two creeks meet and are crossed by a log bridge—there were butterflies everywhere, which the little was overjoyed about. This was one trip, and it was probably one that we planned on a whim, picking the trail based on what was within an hour’s drive. That’s what made it special; there wasn’t anything particularly distinctive about that trail, hike, or day (except for the butterflies, which were pretty neat), and both this absence of distinctiveness coupled with a sense of someting special has nearly always been the case for the time I’ve spent in the Smokies. So, as a bit of a thesis, it’s hard to understand the Smokies: they’re too large, varied, and rich. But, it is possible to experience the Smokies, and doing so doesn’t require making it to Mt. LeConte or Abrams Falls or Clingman’s Dome (though each of those are pretty great). One can perhaps have just as positive of an experience as at those (sometimes busy) sites off trails or at picnic areas in the Big Creek, Cosby, and Tremont areas. I’ll stop for now but resume with some more specific, practical thoughts on the Smokies and where to walk/hike, backpack, camp, run, and cycle. Acknowledgments Thank you to Daniel Anderson for the basis for the theme for this book. Thank you to Samuel Weisbord, Aaron Rosenberg, and Kevin Lane for photos included in this book. "],["why.html", "Why this book", " Why this book We have been taking trips for around years During the past year, due to COVID, outdoor trips were the main thing we did with our child We have done a lot of research, but we are only writing about places we have visited, hiked, paddled, and camped at with our little one Its location is really great (see here) It can be under-rated and hard to learn about Principles that motivate this book: We write about places we go to regularly; in principle, at least twice, and in many cases, many times more than that.

Fitness Start small. Know your limits, have a bail out. Weather Many guides describe the Tennessee weather in a way like the following: In East Tennessee, there are four seasons of weather, including a hot, humid summer, and a cold winter, with temperatures regularly dipping below freezing. Spring and fall bring mild weather, with a lot of variation, especially around the shoulder months of March-April and October-November. This is mostly true, but it fails to capture what it’s like to live in this area. We moved from Michigan—and Michigan is certainly a place in which there are four seasons. Indeed, it sometimes feels like the winter is the longest season in Michigan. That’s not the case in Tennessee as the balance between the seasons is different and this has profound impacts. We’ll try to summarize the experience of each of the seasons in East Tennessee and how the progression of a typical year may unfold. Spring Summer Fall Winter Safety A question that many ask about the Smokies, particularly, but also hiking, generally, has to do with safety concerning a very specific concern: bears. There are black bears in the Smokies: around 1,500 of them. Moreover, there are black bears in the Big South Fork area of the Cumberland Plateau: The latest estimates suggest that a population of around one dozen bears that were introduced in the late 1990s are doing very well and now comprise a population of nearly 1,000 bears. Given these numbers of bears and the number of visitors to both parks - more than 12M to the Smokies in 2020 alone, the number of people who are harmed by bears can be instructive. &lt;&gt; There is data on the number of people killed in the Smokies. These data provide an important context for a discussion of safety (note, we’ll also discuss safety-related issues that don’t have to do with death). From 2010-2020, the National Park Service recorded 92 deaths. 42 were from automobile or other transportation-related accidents. 15 were medical/natural deaths. Six were drownings, three were falls, two were poisoning, and 10 were either “environmental” or in the other category. Denominator [https://www.psblaw.com/nevada/deaths-in-us-national-parks/] The park has seen, on average, more than 10M visitors/year from the 2010-2020 period. In the entire history of the park, there have been around six bear attacks and there have been two deaths from those attacks (in 2000 and 2020). Considering deaths in the last decade, this suggests that bear attacks are exceedingly rare—on the order of one in one hundred million. Something a lot of people mention about the Smokies is the prevalence of bears. From what I can tell, there have been 6-7 bear attacks in the history of the park and two deaths (2000 &amp; 2020) from them. Those are bad, but the park received ~100M visitors from 2010-2019 alone. This suggests that the risk of dying from a bear attack is around in 100M. The risk of being attacked is somewhere around 1 in 30-60M (as it’s somewhat unclear when the documented attacks occurred).

The Appalachian Trail crosses the highway - I-40 - and at different points along the drive one is between a few and five or so miles from the Smokies. The drive is often a bit wild; rock slides very regularly close the highway, sometimes for weeks. At the same time, when moving to Knoxville, I am not sure I could have said what or where the Cumberland Plateau is. This sounds absolutely banal, but I believe the key to initially understanding the area is that it’s a plateau–and that makes it distinct from the mountains. Also, it’s different from Michigan. Here’s a picture from this past weekend at Big South Fork: twin arches in big south fork Ostensibly, one of the Twin Arches is the largest ock arch in the Eastern United States and one of the largest in the world. I think being a part of the Cumberland Plateau - being close to the Southern Appalachian and Smoky moutains - they slip beneath peoples’ radar. There seems to be a near-constant conservation effort, with more land being purchased to be public. Taking the acreage of Big South Fork National (part of the National Park system; ~125,000) and the Cumberland Trail (~35,000), Fall Creek Falls (25,000), Frozen Head (~25,000), South Cumberland (~25,000), and Pickett (20,000) State Parks alone (there are other public lands), this area is around half of the size of the Smokies (~500,000 acres). This is all to say, I have an interest in spending more time in this area and to try to understand it a bit better.
