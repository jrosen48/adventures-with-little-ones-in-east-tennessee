Welcome to our book! I’ve been meaning to work on Little Kids, Big Trips in Knoxville, an open book, for awhile, but like for several (work-related and other) things, I have dropped the ball a bit. To get the ball rolling, I’m going to share a few thoughts on why it can be hard to understand the Smokies as well as a bit of what I’ve come to understand about them. This is nice. Why it can be hard to understand the Smokies The Smokies can be a bit hard to get one’s head around at first. It can be hard to get one’s head around the Smokies for several reasons: Their size: more than 800 square miles Their location: split roughly between Tennessee and North Carolina, there are many ways to access the park, and there isn’t a primary or best way to do so Their variation in altitude: Abrams Creek—the trailhead nearest to Knoxville—is roughly 850 feet above sea level, whereas Clingman’s Dome is roughly 6,650 feet above sea level Their biodiversity: it may be the most biodiverse National Park Their human history: thousands of people of European ancestry lived in what is now the National Park up until as recently as 1934 (when the park was established); before people of European ancestry lived there, thousands of people of Cherokee ancestry lived there; these histories remain alive and present within the park I think these reasons are important in general and in a bit of an abstract sense, but they also have a more personal angle: The Smokies are hard to experience for each of these and other reasons, too. They appear and are different in different seasons. They are very different when experienced when walking than when driving in a car. They are different when it’s rainy and when it’s not. And, they are different alone, with family, with friends, and with a child. A bit on my understanding of the Smokies When my wife and I first decided to move to Knoxville, I began trying to understand the Smokies, and since then I’ve read a lot of books and spent a lot of time there. I don’t think I can adequately summarize the Smokies, but I can begin to convey my understanding. The Smokies are a timeless place, at once welcoming and severe. When I drive to the Smokies, I feel like I’m entering into a special place. That special feeling is amplified by the good memories I’ve had there—with my family and friends and on my own. I value living by the Smokies a lot. This is a function of a lot of things coming together: stopping refereeing soccer, something I’d done for around 12 years up to that point, soon after we moved to Knoxville, the pandemic, which prevented many other activities from happening, and a live for doing things outdoors that motivated me to study biology and enter teaching to begin. I’ll describe just one trip to try to work to summarize my understanding of the Smokies. In May, 2020, my wife and little one and I hiked the beginning of the Bote Mountain and West Prong trails to the location of Backcountry site #18. It was one of our first times heading out after the pandemic began, and it was a moderately difficult hike - around three miles, but with nearly 1,000 feet of climbing. When we arrived at the site—where two creeks meet and are crossed by a log bridge—there were butterflies everywhere, which the little was overjoyed about. This was one trip, and it was probably one that we planned on a whim, picking the trail based on what was within an hour’s drive. That’s what made it special; there wasn’t anything particularly distinctive about that trail, hike, or day (except for the butterflies, which were pretty neat), and both this absence of distinctiveness coupled with a sense of someting special has nearly always been the case for the time I’ve spent in the Smokies. So, as a bit of a thesis, it’s hard to understand the Smokies: they’re too large, varied, and rich. But, it is possible to experience the Smokies, and doing so doesn’t require making it to Mt. LeConte or Abrams Falls or Clingman’s Dome (though each of those are pretty great). One can perhaps have just as positive of an experience as at those (sometimes busy) sites off trails or at picnic areas in the Big Creek, Cosby, and Tremont areas. This book leaves off here.

Fitness Start small. Know your limits, have a bail out. Weather Many guides describe the Tennessee weather in a way like the following: In East Tennessee, there are four seasons of weather, including a hot, humid summer, and a cold winter, with temperatures regularly dipping below freezing. Spring and fall bring mild weather, with a lot of variation, especially around the shoulder months of March-April and October-November. This is mostly true, but it fails to capture what it’s like to live in this area. We moved from Michigan—and Michigan is certainly a place in which there are four seasons. Indeed, it sometimes feels like the winter is the longest season in Michigan. That’s not the case in Tennessee as the balance between the seasons is different and this has profound impacts. We’ll try to summarize the experience of each of the seasons in East Tennessee and how the progression of a typical year may unfold. Spring Summer Fall Winter Safety A question that many ask about the Smokies, particularly, but also hiking, generally, has to do with safety concerning a very specific concern: bears. There are black bears in the Smokies: around 1,500 of them. Moreover, there are black bears in the Big South Fork area of the Cumberland Plateau: The latest estimates suggest that a population of around one dozen bears that were introduced in the late 1990s are doing very well and now comprise a population of nearly 1,000 bears. Given these numbers of bears and the number of visitors to both parks - more than 12M to the Smokies in 2020 alone, the number of people who are harmed by bears can be instructive. &lt;&gt; There is data on the number of people killed in the Smokies. These data provide an important context for a discussion of safety (note, we’ll also discuss safety-related issues that don’t have to do with death). From 2010-2020, the National Park Service recorded 92 deaths. 42 were from automobile or other transportation-related accidents. 15 were medical/natural deaths. Six were drownings, three were falls, two were poisoning, and 10 were either “environmental” or in the other category. Denominator [https://www.psblaw.com/nevada/deaths-in-us-national-parks/] The park has seen, on average, more than 10M visitors/year from the 2010-2020 period. In the entire history of the park, there have been around six bear attacks and there have been two deaths from those attacks (in 2000 and 2020). Considering deaths in the last decade, this suggests that bear attacks are exceedingly rare—on the order of one in one hundred million. Something a lot of people mention about the Smokies is the prevalence of bears. From what I can tell, there have been 6-7 bear attacks in the history of the park and two deaths (2000 &amp; 2020) from them. Those are bad, but the park received ~100M visitors from 2010-2019 alone. This suggests that the risk of dying from a bear attack is around in 100M. The risk of being attacked is somewhere around 1 in 30-60M (as it’s somewhat unclear when the documented attacks occurred). Where to begin Conveient "],["introduction-to-the-smokies.html", "Introduction to the Smokies", " Introduction to the Smokies Transcribed by https://otter.ai I wanted to use this time to talk a little bit about Abrams Creek. Abrams Creek is sort of essential. I think the reason why it’s special is partially because of good memories that we’ve had there. When we moved to Knoxville in May of 2018, my brother and I decided to go on a short overnight backpacking trip. Areas Creek was the closest part of the Smokies to Knoxville and we were hoping that my parents and wife and son could come and join us. I remember when we were walking in we were quickly surrounded by massive airbox. And it just felt like a magical place. Our first night, we camped at the backcountry site, just about a mile and from the trailhead. In the next morning, we ran to Abrams Falls. And then back to me, my parents wife and little one I had no idea what to expect was our first trip to the Smokies and I had very few reference points. Another moment I remember was rounding a corner to approach a rooms halls. There was something about it that felt like you were just entering somewhere different. I think this could have to do with the geography of the area in that Abrams is the lowest trailhead in the park. And so in a sense, the area around the trailhead is distinct from the rest of the park. But as you approach Abrams Falls, you approach the Cades Cove area, comma, the elevation is considerably higher, comma, and it feels a little bit different. Not that the area outside is not special, but it just feels different. I think if I could capture my experience of the Smokies little moments like this where you turn a corner on a hiking trail, and then there’s someplace magical that’s far from the only place where I’ve experienced this. Another example was also on the Cades Cove area. This was near an area called Point host sync. I got hiking with my son and friend and his two children on the schoolhouse gap trail a good if not slightly. On. Exciting trail. But halfway through two people asked us where white oak sticks are having not heard of it before we looked on the map and saw it looked like it was basically in the middle of nowhere with no trails to it. After talking with several more people, we learned that white oak sick is a steep wildflower area. That is especially gorgeous around April, the time that we were there. We found the not on maps trail to widow sick and had out there with her kids. And something changed. Far after beating on the trail. It seemed like a different place where the trees were a bit larger and the sun a bit brighter. And there was just a permeating sense that this was simply special one last story that captures him smoking magic was heading with my wife it’s not to backcountry site 18 Not to camp but just to use that area. As a stopping point on an approximately three mile hike, The hike was good and the weather was great. But when we got to the countryside, there was just something in there. The light was perfect. The two creeks that flowed together are magical. And there were butterflies everywhere. Our son couldn’t stop giggling and chasing them I can go on with stories like this of the Father’s day hike in Abrams Creek or riving. Up at Mount Collins on January hike with my friend Kevin. Or coming down to our caves from Ellicott for the first time or seeing Big Creek with my son these are the kinds of things that capture this book. Notably, none of them necessarily involve most famous parts of the park. Sometimes they do but more often they don’t get more subtle and surprising and rewarding.

The trailhead—the place where one trail (or, often, several trails) begin—is the lowest elevation of any in the park: the trailhead is at 1,168 feet; Knoxville’s is 886. For many, it’s also the closest trailhead, taking less than an hour to travel to from most parts of Knoxville. Though accessible, it’s not nothing in terms of scenery: It has what we would think of as “National Park-level” beauty. There are many great trails as well as backcountry camping options; many of both are along the creek. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies; the best thing I can say about Abrams Creek is that we always seem to have fun when we go there. Getting There The drive there is also mostly easy, but with enough excitement to make that part of the adventure interesting. Getting to Abrams Creek involves driving south from the Knoxville past the the Tyson-McGee Airport and then Maryville. Soon after leaving the outskirts of Maryville, the road climbs up with the Foothills Parkway; the road becomes quite steep, but still accessible. After crossing under the Foothills Parkway, you drive down into the area outside of the Abrams Creek Trailhead and Campground. Getting One’s Bearings It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be a bit confusing. This is because the campground is further along the same road the trailhead is on. Also, there are two areas to park for the trailhead: One is near the large sign with maps of this area of the National Park, and the other is right before the gate that is closed when the campground closes (). We usually park by the gate. Trails There are trails that we enjoy. Little Adventure A little adventure involves walking from the trailhead to the campground. This may not sound like much, but it’s actually a great walk along the creek on a wide, gravel road. Moreover, the campground - like Abrams Creek - is almost never full, apart from prime weekends and holidays, and it’s a great spot to rest by picnic tables and hang out around the creek.

Our epic, just real, quick, wild remote. Instead, the Tennessee Valley is compared to the Smokies and Cumberland Plateau, relatively tame, quite accessible, and in some ways a little bit mundane. However, the Tennessee Valley has several special spots. And at least compared to areas in which I’ve lived in the past, is kind of special spots will not only be nice, but would be wonderful destinations on their own. And indeed, they are still wonderful destinations on their own. Even when the Smokies were the Cumberland Plateau or I’ll briefly describe what has become one of our family’s favorite spots, seven islands is deeper. seven islands is only 30 minutes from Knoxville. And from looking on a map at it, you can get the sense that it’s pretty because it’s the French Broad River. But that there’s not anything special about it apart from the fact that it’s a burning State Park. However, the drive out to it betrays this sense. sort of similar to the Obed. Getting there is a little bit weird. As soon as you exit the interstates, it’s not really clear whether you’re headed the right way. And Google maps often presents multiple greens that are about the same distance. Moreover, it’s not really clear where the state park begins and other lands. And there’s certain parts where it looks like it’s managed by the State Park Service, but it’s actually just part of the road there. In any case, once you approach the road leading up to this depart, you get the sense that there’s something special. There’s the kind of combination of farm and pastoral mountain scenery. That always surprises me. You can typically see some of the mountains from the drive up but not all. And once parking at the parking lot, you can head one of at least four different ways. The first way is out the paved path. And this leads to a bridge that crosses the French rock grammar to one of my left with a short trailer on it. The second way involves hitting up a ridge along meadow, and this way offers great views of mountains and clear days, especially given that we’re in the relatively far eastern portion of the park. A third way involves going up into the forest. And for some reason, this trail always delights me, it’s only about a mile and change. But I don’t seem to go up there without having some kind of special experience. For instance, seeing about a dozen here on a fairly working day fall day. Or going with my son and friend and is having what felt like an epic little mountain hike in a fairly short period of time. The fourth way is a route down to a different part of the park. I’m diving into the details here without focusing on the Gestalt which is the seminar islands, she says something special about it, I don’t know how else to describe it. Especially when you’re on the fringe, Robert Murray just feels like a kind of place to clear your mind, even within half an hour. It feels very, very different than even the amazing places that are not so sometimes, or even places that are also in Knox County such as house well. I think times, the best thing I can say about southern islands is that it has a bit you can hike, I can walk on a path, you can head over a bridge to River Island, you can paddle the only thing that’s missing is camping. And in some ways, I’m kind of glad that it doesn’t have camping and that it becomes a special kind of a trip or a spa place that you can’t ever really feel like you completely understand because you can’t stay there for more than half a day or so. I’ll say a few more things about the Tennessee Valley. This is a big area and in some ways, it’s the area that I feel like I know the least. But I’ll speak to a few other spots that are present here. One is North stamp State Park and Norton says kind of quasi weird and quasi while in a kind of quasi Cumberland ish kind of way. The name itself is epic, and it’s kind of 1950s Harsh architectural style. And the area and hiking trails around Norris are pretty nice. It’s not quite the strongest endorsement so let me try that I actually don’t have a lot to say about horse yet another spot I’ll mention is house mount house is about the same distance from Knoxville as separate island property, and it has that feature of being somewhere a world removed from Knoxville despite being only a short drive away. One thing that always strikes me about housebound is that it’s quite steep. You might not expect it in the context of the Smokies being nearby. But the hike is really intense and it’s challenged me and my family multiple times. The overlooks from Haas mountain I’m pretty good.

The Appalachian Trail crosses the highway - I-40 - and at different points along the drive one is between a few and five or so miles from the Smokies. The drive is often a bit wild; rock slides very regularly close the highway, sometimes for weeks. At the same time, when moving to Knoxville, I am not sure I could have said what or where the Cumberland Plateau is. This sounds absolutely banal, but I believe the key to initially understanding the area is that it’s a plateau–and that makes it distinct from the mountains. Also, it’s different from Michigan. Here’s a picture from this past weekend at Big South Fork: twin arches in big south fork Ostensibly, one of the Twin Arches is the largest ock arch in the Eastern United States and one of the largest in the world. I think being a part of the Cumberland Plateau - being close to the Southern Appalachian and Smoky moutains - they slip beneath peoples’ radar. There seems to be a near-constant conservation effort, with more land being purchased to be public. Taking the acreage of Big South Fork National (part of the National Park system; ~125,000) and the Cumberland Trail (~35,000), Fall Creek Falls (25,000), Frozen Head (~25,000), South Cumberland (~25,000), and Pickett (20,000) State Parks alone (there are other public lands), this area is around half of the size of the Smokies (~500,000 acres). This is all to say, I have an interest in spending more time in this area and to try to understand it a bit better.

Just when it starts to feel like you’re entering a more outdoorsy girl place your approach the Morgan State Penitentiary, one of the largest prisons in Tennessee. Adding to the slightly strange but also well, it’s really not much else it is since that frozen head can break, you have to drive past the State Penitentiary to get to the skate park. Collectively, these aspects of the driving don’t let frozen had a sense of the epic or survive, like you get traffic into the Smokies period. There’s basically no way to approach the school piece that doesn’t feel majestic. Period. Moreover, you typically lose cell service, either as you enter the park or before adding to the sense of the Smokies is remote. It’s separate from the rest of the area. FirstNet isn’t really like that. It’s less than an hour from Knoxville. And I found that many in Knoxville, even those who have been here for a while don’t know about it. It has a campground and also a lot of functions for getting outside. Let me focus on the campground for a minute. The camera itself is just perfect. It’s hard to describe it other than that. It’s small about 20 sites and they do allow trailers but only those below it’s like most of the campers most of the time I’ve been in Frozen sleeping tents, but there are also a number of pop ups and small travel trailers. It’s the kind of campground where every site is nice. The sites that seem most immediately appealing are those that are on the right as you drive into the campground. These are the sites that are along the creek. They’re large and they overlook a fairly steep drop off down to the water. However, we’ve mostly stated other sites and they have other aspects that make them desirable. For one there’s true ganttic boulders everywhere. This is one thing that makes the Cumberland Plateau different than the Smokies. For another it’s such a small campground and it’s laid out in such a way that it always seems safe for children it’s just a great spot to hang out. Moreover, it’s close to the playground. Which itself is fine but is made even nicer by a bridge that crosses over the creek as well as easy access to the creek. Collectively, these make camping area just a really great place to hang out with kids, whether overnight or on a day trip. There are two other things about frozen head that make it really good for kids. First, there’s a good hike that’s just long enough to be interesting. To a waterfall, Emery falls. It’s a great, moderately challenging hike that almost always pretty. Second, there’s an Riverwalk along the creek below the campground that makes for good short trips. There are also nice scenic trails around some of the trails that lead up to the backcountry sites. I’ll tell one more story about frozen head and that’s a time when I took my son late in the day. He let them drive out there and we arrived sometime around 4pm We started hiking on the trail onto the waterfall and almost everyone we saw was heading back toward us as we get farther and on the trail and get quieter and quieter and we said to go past the first of all that had for a second. This is another one of those hikes that had a touch of What makes this smokey special just moments where the landscape changes a little bit, and the lights shining through the trees is just right. And somehow the place seems very different from the rest of the surroundings. For some reason there’s something about driving home from frozen head that always sticks with me. I’m not sure why but for whatever reason, the drive home seems more adventurous and majestic than the drive there. Driving to Oak Ridge is nice because you have options for places to stop. Moreover, driving past all of West Knoxville on I 40 on the way home gives you a ton of options for dinner and closer to home. Another thing about frozen heads location is that it’s close to a little bit wild and scenic river. And then a few occasions we’ve combined the frozen head and Obed we’ll talk about Obed next Camping Transcribed by https://otter.ai I’d like to share a few thoughts on frozen head State Park. The first time I went to frozen head was with our neighborhood friends, and their friends and all of our children. There were three kids and three dads when we went. And it was the first time I’ve gone camping with my son. When we pulled up, our friends were at the playground by the creek creek that flows through frozen bed. And my son instantly seemed happy to be there. I remember getting out and playing and running back and forth between the campsite and the playground. As we approached the thing, we made dinner, and my son did great play with tractors and with the other kids that time. But as I started to get late, and later, sleep seemed like he was going to be in trouble. After watching cartoons at the turn for around 45 minutes, I said didn’t seem any closer to falling asleep. And I was starting to become anxious about what would happen. One point he was insisting on going in the car, ostensibly, because he thought they would help us to get home back to his bed. I obliged for a minute, which maybe was not a good call. But we went into the car and he insisted on sitting in his car seat. Period not looking good. I was feeling close to my wit’s end, it was around 11pm. Both of my friends were asleep. We didn’t seem anywhere close to falling asleep in the car. I started thinking about what we would need to do the next day to come back to get our stuff. When we drove home. Making it home after midnight. I remember my son asking What a noise was I forget exactly how the conversation unfolded. But he said something like, is that a motorcycle? And I said something like no, I don’t think so. And then he said, Ted, and I asked him tent. And we headed back into the tent. And he promptly fell asleep. This was one of those moments that actually like was big. Maybe in retrospect, a few weeks or months later, we would have had a camping trip and this seemingly important event wouldn’t have come on. But it felt like a huge breakthrough for me, for my son and for us. And that we could have gone home back to his bed. And he could have cried or continued to not fall asleep. And we were really close to him. But we decided to stay and the amount of confidence and joy they gave me was hard to describe "],["obed.html", "Obed", " Obed Transcribed by https://otter.ai Obed Wild and Scenic River is a special place. That’s becoming a bit of a refrain for me here. But it’s one of those places that always does feel a little bit different, a little bit quirky and a little special. I wouldn’t ever use the words Corky to describe the Smokies it just doesn’t fit. But there’s something about the Cumberland Plateau that’s distinctly quirky, and weird and wild, especially in its own way, not in the majestic way that the Smokies are. I feel like I can’t put into words what makes the color of the planet or the way it is. I think part of it is the terrain, which is very rocky, and very different from both the Smokies and the Tennessee Valley. Another thing about the Cumberland Plateau is that just getting there is always a little bit weird. Whereas driving to the Smokies you pass science and I’m seeing that you’re entering a national park. And pretty much regardless of the entrance except for heading to Abrams, you’re going to pass businesses that cater toward tourists to the park. Well, also Big Creek, okay, there’s many that don’t cater to tourists. But entering the park the main ways you will see many signs that you are entering the very large, very busy National Park, the opposite almost always seems to be true for the number of plateau. This is especially the case for Obed, which is kind of commonly hard to find. Once I drove with my son to the point trail, as indicated by Google Maps, it’s a great trail and one that I’ve been to several times before. But Google Maps was just wrong. It took me to the middle of nowhere. And when I got home, I confirm that somehow there were two locations for the point trail and one of them wasn’t close to the other. I actually ended up finding the point trail on that trip but added about 30 minutes of driving it was super stressful, because in that area, there was a GPS or cell signal. I ended up submitting an edit to Google Maps. I’m not sure it ever got made. If a project frozen had feels a little bit quirky, driving into a rural area and then passed the state penitentiary driving to Obed just always gives you the sense that there couldn’t possibly be something managed by the National Park Service here. It’s just very rural, and again, weird and quirky. And on occasion I pass things that make me uncomfortable, like Confederate flags, and signs of abject poverty. Although I’m not sure that makes me uncomfortable so much. It’s just gives me a sense that this is somewhere that’s different from somewhere where people live their lives in a very different way than when you approach overhead, you’ll cross a bridge, which according to a guide that I’ve read used to be a party spot for area kids. Now it has been tables and looks like somewhere managed by the National Park Service. Even heading over the bridge, it’s not really apparent that you’re headed to a trailhead it just kind of looks like he drove past the river and now you’re heading back into another quasi rural area. But about a mile past the river is a trailhead to the point Trail, which is one of those trails that always seems to be associated with good memories. The correlation and causation is difficult, difficult to disentangle when it comes to trips with family and friends. Is it that we selected to go to these places on beautiful days when we’re feeling ready to go hiking in the rainy or cloudy or too cool days are the days on which we didn’t feel great. Did you just stay home? Question mark. I don’t think that’s strictly the case because there have been many days where we have been outside when it’s cold, quite cold, or when we get rained on or when our move just isn’t quite right. But still in all of those cases. These areas seem to be providing a table that if one is open to it, can open can give one’s problems can provide the medicine that in any case. I’m going to speak first about a year. We took his family COVID It was a beautiful spring day and we headed out on the trail which will first cross head down into well First, you can head out to the overlook, which is gorgeous. I think it’s one of the prettiest overlooks in the area, and that the obit just looks mild and rustic and very hard to access all things that are. After the overlook you head down to the valley, where you cross a bridge covering, crossing a creek with a lot of Magnolia I’m sorry, a lot of rhododendron all around, it feels very tropical and wet. You then head up past a lot of trees that are very emblematic of this like the Bigleaf magnolia. These are trees that shed their leaves in Pepin fashion in the fall. According to many tree guides, they are the trees with the largest deciduous leaves. After you head up from the Creek Valley, you had to rocky area with boulders all around and then a fairly large rock face in front of you. The rock face looks semi amenable to climbing but of course, the trail doesn’t go up, and there is a pathway around it. And then up to the top of the rock face, behind which the entire type of environment seems to change again to qualify open Ridge walk. Heading up to the point. This part of the trail is really lovely. And in some ways. What makes this show special is the variety overlook the creek in the rocky area, the ridge walk this area, this hike leads out to the intersection with another trail. And at this point, the environment seems to change and the soil becomes really sad. And you notice that you are sitting on a ridge line with fairly steep drop offs on either side. After a short distance, you approach a covered rocky area, which makes it a good place to stack. Continuum. Another word for somewhere around half a mile is the end of the trail and a nice overlook. But I don’t think it’s necessarily nicer or more than that we’re looking at the beginning of the make or the cool rock shelter. And indeed, it’s just a bit far for shorter hiking with family and kiddos. On the day that we went out to bed for the first time, or son fell asleep on the way back in my arms or something it took me I did a period across the ridge. I’ll pass the rock area over the bridge and the backup to the parking area where we headed through the parking lot and down toward the boulder. He continued sleeping and it was just one of those perfect moments. The weather was great. It was rested. We were happy after he finally woke up and we headed to a brewery nearby. And that too was about as diplomatic as the obits weirdness as as possible. seemed less like a brewery and more like someone’s house that happened to sell beer that they made there. That was really good. Yeah, they also had food which shared the same quality. It wasn’t really clear even what the menu was they were just sort of making food and you were sort of placing orders by this point pretty hot in the day and we ended up with a slightly creepy toddler. But it was still a great trip and a great way to have a great night.
