## Weather

Many guides describe the Tennessee weather in a way like the following:

> In East Tennessee, there are four seasons of weather, including a hot, humid summer, and a cold winter, with temperatures regularly dipping below freezing. Spring and fall bring mild weather, with a lot of variation, especially around the shoulder months of March-April and October-November.

This is mostly true, but it fails to capture what it's _like_ to live in this area. We moved from Michigan---and Michigan is certainly a place in which there are four seasons. Indeed, it sometimes feels like the winter is the longest season in Michigan. That's not the case in Tennessee as the _balance_ between the seasons is different and this has profound impacts. 

We'll try to summarize the _experience_ of each of the seasons in East Tennessee and how the progression of a typical year may unfold.
